Review the API examples using the Unirest library.

Create a new Maven project, and add Unirest to your project.

Use the OMBD API to write a movie search program.

Sign up for a free API key http://www.omdbapi.com/ and review the documentation for making queries.

In your program, the user should be able to enter a movie name. Your program will make a request to OMDB's API and get information about that movie.

Display a neatly formatted message with all the information returned about that movie. 

If the movie isn't found, print a "Not Found" message.

Make sure your API key is not in the program code! Save it in an environment variable on your computer.

Comment your code!!

Create a GitHub repository for your project, and push your code to GitHub.
